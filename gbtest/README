jsGB: A GameBoy emulator in JavaScript
--------------------------------------

jsGB is an interpretive emulator of the GameBoy, designed to be run from
within a web browser. Yes, it's written in JavaScript.

Current status:

- The emulator is currently hard-coded to load a particular ROM; it should
  be possible at some point to develop a fancy dialog for display and
  loading of the ROMs available at the server.
- CPU: Emulated, including the CB-page opcodes. There are likely to be
  opcodes in the standard lists that are missing, and the "undocumented"
  ops will be missing.
- Graphics: Backgrounds and sprites emulated, windows missing.
- Keypad: Working.
- Timer: Untested.
- Interrupts: VBlank and timer emulated.
- Sound: Missing.

Tested browsers:

- FireFox 3.6
- Opera 10
