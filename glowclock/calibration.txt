Uncomment the #define CALIBRATE line and upload the program.

Remove the arms from the servos if they are already attached.

Press the time button. The light should turn on and the servos will rotate.

Attach the servo arms:
 - left servo pointing up
 - right servo pointing right

Press the button again. The light should turn off.
Servo arms should rotate ~ 90 degrees to the left.

Adjust the SERVO_LEFT_ZERO and SERVO_RIGHT_ZERO values so the arms are perfectly horizontal when pointing to the side in calibration mode.

DO NOT adjust the SCALE values until the ZEROs are set correctly

Then, adjust SERVO_LEFT_SCALE and SERVO_RIGHT_SCALE so the arms are perfectly vertical when pointing upwards in calibration mode.

To test the calibration, comment #define CALIBRATE and uncomment #define GRID
The clock should draw a grid of dots when you press the button
(There will usually be a small area of misplaced dots along the bottom)

Comment both lines to turn off calibration mode.
